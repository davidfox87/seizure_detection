# General info

In this mini-project, I attempt to apply different machine learning models to automatically classify EEG time series into diseased (seizure) and healthy (non-seizure) groups. To do this, i applied signal processing (Filtering, Fourier, and Wavelet transforms) to each EEG recording to obtain a feature space. Using SKlearn pipelines, I compared all the classical models including logistic regression, SVM, and KNNs with ensemble tree-based methods such as decision trees, random-forest and XGboost.

I also apply a convolutional neural network model (Tensorflow/Keras) to classify overlapping 2 s windows of EEG time series. Although, deep-learning was not necessary in this problem, its use was just for didactic purposes.

I uploaded these codes to demostrate the following abilities:

* Excellent understanding of Machine Learning/Deep Learning, methodologies for clinical outcomes research
* Strong understanding of signal processing concepts (Filtering, Fourier, and Wavelet transforms).
* Experience with deep neural network architectures and software frameworks like TensorFlow.
* Strong programming skills in Python and familiarity with python libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, pandas etc.
